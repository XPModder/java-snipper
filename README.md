# java-snipper
A simple small java based snipping tool with the goal of implementing most features of the windows snipping tool

# WIP
This project is still Work In Progress, however it should now mostly work and should do so reliably (at least I hope it does)!
<br>
There are still a few known issues with this, so be aware of that when you use it.
<br>
As this is still WIP, please do not create issues on github for this project, as there are several things I am aware of and dont need reminding.
<br>
Once this project is out of the WIP phase, you may of course create issues to report bugs or other problems.
